### FAQ for  "We already have a billing company"

1. "We're unhappy with our current biller"

2. "Thinking about switching"

3. "Comparing options"


----------------------------------------
**Example Answer**

Hi **(Add the company name or busniess or who ever is the person that emailed us, also could add more then one person if it is a corp or larger company)**

I appreciate you reaching out, and I understand the decision to switch billing companies 
isn't taken lightly.

Common reasons businesses make the switch:

- Lack of transparency in billing processes
- Poor communication and slow responses
- High denial rates or aging AR
- Feeling like just another account number

We'd be happy to provide a free assessment of your current billing performance to identify 
opportunities for improvement - no strings attached. This often reveals issues you didn't 
even know existed.

The transition process is smoother than you might think (typically 2-3 weeks), and we 
handle all the heavy lifting.
